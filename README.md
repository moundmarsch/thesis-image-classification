Waste is one of the significant environmental issues in many countries, including Indonesia. The accumulation of waste has become a serious problem for various reasons, one of which is the lack of effective waste sorting processes. Waste sorting is crucial so that waste can be processed immediately and prevent prolonged accumulation. Therefore, innovation is needed, such as developing technology that can efficiently identify and classify waste images. This research focuses on the development of technology to classify organic, inorganic, and hazardous waste using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method. The main objective of this research is to make the waste sorting process easier, thus addressing the issue of waste accumulation more effectively. The model architecture uses the Residual Network 50 (ResNet-50) architecture, which is one of the most popular models for image classification. The model is trained with a dataset that has two types of labeling to test its performance. The first model was trained with 14 data labels representing different types of waste, and the second model was trained with 3 data labels: organic, inorganic, and hazardous. The training results show that the first condition achieved an accuracy of 99,4%, while the second condition achieved an accuracy of 98,6%. These results demonstrate that ResNet-50 can handle image classification very well, especially for waste type classification
